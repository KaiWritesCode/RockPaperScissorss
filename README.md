This is a project built using an html file with javascript inside the script tags. This will demonstrate my ability to use simple logic to use the inputs (rock, paper, and scissors) into functions to output the winner.

See Live Demo: https://kaiwritescode.github.io/RockPaperScissorss/

Rules: (Wikipedia)
Zero-sum game, it has only two possible outcomes: a draw, or a win for one player and a loss for the other. A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors", but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie.
